# WEATHER_PREDICTION
This is a rainfall prediction app made using ML(scatter plot,svm,knn,neural networks)



This project aims to develop a rainfall prediction system leveraging Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML). Rainfall prediction is crucial for various sectors like agriculture, water resource management, and disaster preparedness. 
Through this project, we strive to demonstrate the effectiveness of AIML in enhancing the accuracy and reliability of rainfall predictions, thus contributing to better resource management and disaster resilience. We have used supervised learning in this project.
Moreover, rainfall greatly affects human life in various sectors such as agriculture and transportation. Additionally, it can cause natural disasters such as drought, floods, and landslides. The aim of this project is to build an accurate rainfall prediction model so that prescriptive measures can be made.
Overall, accurate rainfall predictions empower users to make informed decisions, adapt to changing weather conditions, and minimize risks associated with precipitation events.
The implementation involves importing libraries such as seaborn, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib etc to efficiently handle and analyse data, ultimately enhancing the user's music discovery experience.
